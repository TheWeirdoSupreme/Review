          <h2>Jalen's 1st Pick: Jane The Virgin</h2>
        </header>
        <p>Jane The Virgin follows a new mother, Jane Villanueva, who was accidentally artificially inseminated and had her whole life turned upside down. As a catholic,
        she was taught that sex is something sacred she should only given her husband upon marriage. We follow her as she balances her life between her true love 
        and her baby's father. I give this shows a 9/10 because while the show is good, it's something you can only watch ones.<p>

          <h2>Jalen's 2nd Pick: Good Girls</h2>
        </header>
        <p>Good Girls follows a trio of moms who find themselves in financial binds. They work together with the help of a gang leader, Rio, in order to carry out
        illegal tasks to make more money. These jobs range from robbing a grocery store, to kidnapping, to theft, to conterfeit. I give this show an 8/10 because
        the concept is rather unique and watching them try to balance their home lives with their illegal lives, is entertaining but some of the plot points
        are also a little generic and boring.</p>
